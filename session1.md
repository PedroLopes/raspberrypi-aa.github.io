##Session 1 - Raspberry Pi Basics

This session covers an overview of the Raspberry Pi's hardware and software capabilities. You will learn how to start your Raspberry Pi and begin interacting with it for the first time. You will connect to it with a serial cable and then over an ssh network connection. Once connected, you will begin exploring how to write python scripts that can actuate motors and LEDs and interact with external switches and buttons.

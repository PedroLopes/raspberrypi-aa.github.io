## Session 3 - PWM, Audio, Arduino Control
This session will be focused on two main topics. First, we'll examine how to dim LEDs and control motor speed or position with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Then, we'll move on to discussing Arduinos and how they relate to Raspberry Pi. Using the PyFirmata libraries, we'll control an Arduino from a Raspberry Pi's python script. If time allows, we'll explore the MCP3008 Analog to Digital converter.
